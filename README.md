# Kubernetes Cluster on Raspberry Pi's

This project is to experiment with 3d printing and developing a low powered Kubernetes cluster on raspberry Pi’s. As I am creating/printing the cluster case itself, I want to include a switch, power, and space for the raspberry Pi’s in a compact and portable manor.

## Requirements:
1 Ender 3 pro (or similar 3 printer)
3x Raspberry Pi 3
1x TP link 8 port switch unmanaged switch https://www.amazon.com/Ethernet-Splitter-Optimization-Unmanaged-TL-SG108/dp/B00A121WN6
1x Anker 60w 6 port USB charging station amazon.com/Anker-Charger-PowerPort-iPhone-Galaxy/dp/B00P936188/
3x Right angle Micro USB Cable https://www.amazon.com/SUNGUY-3-Pack-Degree-Charging-Samsung/dp/B07H172CHD/
